  my MOTHER,<font color="red">SAVITRI,</font> is the heart of our family, and her name itself feels like home. her day begins before sunrise, a silent, loving ritual to ensure our home runs smoothly. she is the first to wake and the last to sleep, always working tirelessly for us. as a housewife, her work is never done, yet she never complains. she is a master of multitasking, effortlessly managing every household chore. the aroma of her delicious cooking fills the kitchen, a promise of comfort and love. she has a special ability to turn simple ingredients into our family's favorite meals. my mother hands are rarely still, always mending, cleaning, caring for someone.
